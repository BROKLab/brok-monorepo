## Development requirements

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) 
- [make](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile) (get started with makefile [mac](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make), [win](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows) )
- [Docker Compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.14.2/)

## Getting started - Local development

Run `make dev`

To clean everything up. Run `make clean`

### EITHER üë©‚Äçüíª Running locally with VSCode tasks (preferred) 
In VScode, run task `dev`  ( ‚áß‚åòB workbench.action.tasks.runTask).  

This will fire up all projects in watch mode so you can develop and experience imdiate results (hopefully across pacakges).
The graph takes some time to start. Once it is started it will keep running in docker as long as your captable contracts terminal is running.

# Deployments
## Release packages of SDK and CapTable
```
pnpm changeset
pnpn changeset version
pnpm install
# commit the changes
pnpm publish -r
```

## Deploy TheGraphCapTable service

Make sure @brok/graph package is useing desired @brok/captable version in package.json

```bash
pnpm --filter @brok/graph deploy:brokDev # deploy:brokLocal deploy:brokStage deploy:brokProd
```

## Deploy frontends and servers

Will deploy by instructions of render.yaml file. 

## Getting started - Remote development

1. Install requirements (docker, docker-compose, pnpm, make, node)
2. Get yourself an Ethereum RPC endpoint (free: [alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) [infura](https://infura.io/) )
3. Get yourself wallets for all enviroments (can create a wallet which contains a seed with `pnpm task utils:seed`)
4. Update .evn varibles in all packages with your endpoints and seeds.
5. Fund wallets on blockchain you are targeting.
--- Make code changes
1. Create new version of @brok/sdk & @brok/captable with `pnpm task publish`
2. Publish new version of @brok/sdk & @brok/captable with `pnpm task publish:commit`
3. Deploy new version of theGraph `pnpm deploy:graph [ENV]`
4. Deploy new version of demo-server `deploy:update:server [ENV]` 
5. Deploy new version of demo-frontend `deploy:update:frontend [ENV]` 


## Deployment
- SDK [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brok/sdk)
- Captable [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brok/captable)
- Graph [HostedService](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/dashboard) (connected to robertosnap account)
- demo-server [Heroku DEV](https://brok-demo-server-dev.herokuapp.com) [Heroku STAGE](https://brok-demo-server-stage.herokuapp.com) 
- demo-frontend [Heroku DEV](https://brok-demo-frontend-dev.herokuapp.com/) [Heroku STAGE](https://brok-demo-frontend-stage.herokuapp.com/)

So SDK and Captable are NPM packages that needs to be published for changes to propegate. 
Graph, demo-server and demo-frontend needs to be deployed to their enviroments to progegate changes.


## Environment variables

The main enviorment variables that you need to familirize with:
- An Etehreum RPC (We recommend [alchemyapi.io](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/) or [Infura](https://infura.io/))
- A ceramic node [https://ceramic.network/](https://ceramic.network/)
- An Ethereum secret (seed phrase). You can generate one with [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
- The Graph API indexing captable contracts [thegraph.com](https://thegraph.com/en/)

### Environment setup
1. Copy .env.example to .env in packages/captable, packages/demo-frontend and packages/demo-server.
1. Get yourself an Ethereum RPC and Ethereum secret and put these into /.env and ./packages/captable/.env
1. Then you should be able to generate the SDK for any chain.

Other env variables are mostly used for deployment to remote servers.

SDK will look for environment variable BROK_ENVIRONMENT to determine which contracts to choose. Set this envrioment in your runtime.
- local brokLocal - Will use local blockchain
- dev brokDev - Will use Arbitrum Rinkeby
- stage brokStage - Will use Arbitrum Rinkeby
- prod brokProd - Will use Arbitrum mainnet (not currently)

To create an approved CapTable, the wallet for fagsystem must first be authorized by BRREG. Contact us.
## Ugly hacks
- If the blockchain node (running inside the captable contracts terminal) is killed, the graph node will stop indexing. To fire it up again run `make graph-stop` then `make graph-start`.
- Tasks that errors will continue to run. Should swap out task system for something that can handle errors in shell.
- Problems with Key DID provider secp256k1 so we are deriving ED25519 from secp256k1 private key.
